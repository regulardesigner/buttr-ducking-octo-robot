buttr - your grid system complete with a delicious piece of butter !
========================
#
Yet another grid system, extremely simple, basic and useful for html. A very old project developed after ten years of html with my old friend Philippe Candille (AKA Fluxen). http://www.fluxen.net/
#
#
Buttr is born in 2009 during a client project. 
#
We wanted to use our own grid system because we found all other grid too complicated or not flexible enough. Since we can not stop using buttr because it has proven extremely useful to create the html code of all the graphics. Yes even the most eccentric!
